Join us to explore the evolution of LLM use cases from content generation to powerful agents capable of doing complex workflows.

In this session, we'll introduce the core concepts behind AI agents, define key terms, and highlight practical use cases and design patterns. Weâ€™ll also provide an overview of AI Agent Service on AI Foundry, showcasing how modern platforms enable the development and deployment of intelligent agents at scale.
